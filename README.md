# molecular-dynamics
The following code maight be used in order to perform a full simulation on molecular dynamics (MD) of a set of 500 particles on a cubic box of 10 units side with periodic bondary conditions. The set of programs are able to build the initial configuration of the system and predict its evolution for any arbitrary time due to the effect of a Lennard-Jonnes potential, keeping track of the coordinates, velocities and accelerations of every particle. Using this information thermodynamic variables are calculated. A detailed expanation about the physics and analysis techniques are presented in the file
