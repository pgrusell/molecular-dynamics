# molecular-dynamics
The following code may be used to perform a full simulation of molecular dynamics (MD) for a set of 500 particles in a cubic box with a side length of 10 units, using periodic boundary conditions. The set of programs is capable of constructing the initial configuration of the system and predicting its evolution for any arbitrary time, influenced by a Lennard-Jones potential. The code keeps track of the coordinates, velocities, and accelerations of every particle. Using this information, thermodynamic variables are calculated. A detailed explanation of the physics and analysis techniques is provided in the [Explicación](explicación.pdf).
